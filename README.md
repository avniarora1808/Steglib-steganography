# Steglib-steganography

Introducing StegLib, a encryption and decryption tool that allows anyone easy access to steganalysis image 
encryption and decryption. With the click of a button, anyone can check if a pertinent image has a secret message 
in it or not, and find out ways to detect them. We designed our website to be as simple as possible since we found 
that the market lacks steganalysis technology, and many don’t even know about the dangers of steganography. Our web 
application allows one to pass through large amounts of data and detect a secret message hidden well within the image. 
We want to raise people’s awareness towards steganalysis, and demonstrate how steganalysis works with visualizations 
and machine learning. Finally, StegLib improves on current state of the art steganalysis models, by giving a fast and 
efficient pipeline for steganalysis to be implemented, and reducing detection and decryption times for steganographed images.
